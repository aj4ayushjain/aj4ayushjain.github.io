Hiya!!

I am Ayush,Computer Science graduate from [PES University,Ecity](https://pesitsouth.pes.edu/) and currently working on design and manufacturing problems at [PCBKingdom](https://pcbkingdom.com) trying to discover my passion and interests along with enjoying the life to fullest maybe a little less :p.

I read,tinker,experiment a lot  and very much curious about things:tech,food and life and love meeting people but I generally prefer solitude over big crowds,but not a complete introvert. I can be very talkative or not at all.

Kinda, currently trying tech geek love at this point in my life. Apart from tech some other things I do as well excite,rejuvenate me travel(which i don't do much),table tennis,,running and maybe cycling some time.

Someday hope to get inspired by great revolutionary idea which motivates me to work like hell and have a positive impact on people's life in *sustainable* way.

That's all !

Thanks....
