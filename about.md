Hiya!!

I am Ayush Jain,Finalyear CS undergrad from PES University,Ecity campus trying to discover my passions and interests and enjoy  the life to fullest.

I truly love meeting new people but pretty shy at times and hate large gatherings:p
Kindda, currently trying out my computer techy geek love at this point in my life. Apart from computers love i love travelling(which i don't do much),table tennis,farming(which need's a little more exploration) and in search for great revolutionary ideas which inpsire me to work on and affects people in positive way.
