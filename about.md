Hiya!!

I am Ayush,Final Year CS undergrad from [PES University,Ecity](https://pesitsouth.pes.edu/) campus trying to discover my passion and interests along with enjoying the life to fullest.

I read and try up a lot things:tech,politics,world events and  love meeting people but i prefer solitude over big crowds,but not  a complete introvert.I can be very talkative or not at all.

Kindda, currently trying tech geek love at this point in my life. Apart from tech some other things i doas well excite,rejuvenate me travel(which i don't do much),table tennis,farming(explored a bit) and little more to add on.

Someday hope to get inspired by great revolutionary idea which motivates me to work like hell and have a positive impact on people's life.

That's all !

Thanks....
