Hiya!!

I am Ayush, graduate from PES [PES University,Ecity](https://pesitsouth.pes.edu/) and currently working on design and manufacturing problems at [PCBKingdom](https://pcbkingdom.com) trying to discover my passion and interests along with enjoying the life to fullest.

I read and try up a lot things:tech,politics,world events , want to understand temples too sometime and love meeting people but i prefer solitude over big crowds,but not a complete introvert. I can be very talkative or not at all.

Kindda, currently trying tech geek love at this point in my life. Apart from tech some other things I do as well excite,rejuvenate me travel(which i don't do much),table tennis,farming(explored a bit) and little more to add on.

Someday hope to get inspired by great revolutionary idea which motivates me to work like hell and have a positive impact on people's life.

That's all !

Thanks....
