Hiya!!

I am Ayush Jain,Final Year CS undergrad from [PES University,Ecity](https://pesitsouth.pes.edu/) campus trying to discover my passions and interests and enjoy  the life to fullest.

I read and try up a lot things:tech,politics,world events and  love meeting people but i prefer solitude over big crowds,but not  a complete introvert.I can be very talkative or not at all.

Kindda, currently trying tech geek love at this point in my life. Apart from tech some other things do excite,rejuvenate me travelling(which i don't do much),table tennis,farming(explored a bit) 

Someday hope to get inspired by   great revolutionary ideas which motivates  me to work like hell and affects people's life in a positive way.

That's all !

Thanks....
