What's up everyone!!.

Nice to see u there reading up my vent actually i am thinking this for a long but not able to write something and sometimes i just feel it's not good enough for the world out there (being introvert)so don't publish it.


Finally it comes out as i am currently feeling way out wierdo:/ Confused Darn:!
 Don't know what's next ,what to do and what's good enough which will fill my heart out with satisfaction. 
Any of my buddies reading this up i miss u Just Call me :) I need help.

Today's the second last day for filling up the GSOC final evaluation form and i'm not satisfied what i have delivered to the organisation till now.I have not given my up to mark work Just's not feeling good about it.

Now ownwards just thinking to write the blog daily and learn,assess and rectify where i do lag.
