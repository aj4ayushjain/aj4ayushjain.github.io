Hey folks! 
This is the final report of what i had been able to accomplish in my  GSOC timeperiod consisting of Work submission links along with the issues.This journey was full of highs and lows and everyday was fighting some fallbacks and hitting them hard.

# What' done?

* Debian directory addition for debian package creation

* Removal unnecessary directories

* Unpacked dependencies addition 


# What's left?

There's lot to be done which i will do after the GSOC period gradually.

* Creation of the docker image for scancode-toolkit

* Creation of package for RPM distribution
